 *
 * Make a class with a main method, the target method , test helper and test cases function
 * Read all instructions. Twice (comments in this calss).
 *
 * Your question will be different than Icy Hot, with different parameters and requirement.
 * IcyHot is a sample.
 *
 * You can copy the structure of IcyHot
 * I will judge on test cases (different test data, testing edge cases, to properly test the requirements)
 *
 * Its not J Unit style, but is single class with solution and unit test cases with main method.
 *
 * Main method calls Test cases function
 *
 * Test cases function calls test helper function repeatedly with different test data and expected value
 *
 * test helper calls target function and compares actual return with expected
 *
 * Target function and, unit test cases and test helper
 * Change the file encoding in your IDE/ text editor to UTF-8 (as some characters are outside of ASCII).
 
 *  no imports just java.lang used. For your problem also do not us java collections or any other classes. 
 * Use simple objects and classes that are in java.lang only.

	 * General test helper for data and expected value unit test.

	 * Calls the target function with given inputs and verifies that

	 *
	 * Notes:
	 * - Parameters before the last one must match the target function's inputs
	 *   in both type and order.
	 * - The last parameter represents the expected return value.
	 * - If the target function signature changes, this helper’s signature
	 *   must be updated accordingly.
	 * - The expected value must be pre-calculated correctly for each test case.
	 *
	 * Example below assumes target signature:
	 *     boolean icyHot(int temp1, int temp2)
	 * 
	 * This function works for this target. But for you, its a sample. The actual number of parameters and parameter types,
	 * for your test helper, will depend on the parameters of your target function, their type and return type.
