          -----------🪻🪻🪻🪻🪻🪻🪻🪻🪻🪻🪻🪻🪻-----------

       💡 How to Play:
       👉 Type 'q' or 'quit' to exit the game.
       ⬆️  Type 'h' or 'higher' if you think your number is **higher** than the computer's.
       ⬇️  Type 'l', 'm', or 'lower' if you think your number is **lower** than the computer's.

       🔁 After 5 rounds, you're asked:
          ➤ Enter how many more rounds to play
          ➤ Or enter '0', 'n', or 'q' to stop

       🎲 Each round:
          - The computer picks a random number.
          - You get a random number.
          - Let the better guesser win! 🏆

       ℹ️  Tip: Only the first letter of your input is parsed —
          e.g., 'hi' is treated as 'higher', and 'qui' as 'quit'. ✅

       Good luck! 🍀
